### Option 1: Create an `index.html` File
1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code provided in the project.
2. **Create a File**: Create a file named `index.html` on your local machine.
3. **Paste the Code**: Paste the copied code into your `index.html` file.

### Option 2: Clone the Repository
1. **Clone the Repository**: You can clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-2-audio.git
   ```

## Deploy to Netlify
To host the site for free using **Netlify**, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Netlify Account**: Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.
2. **Upload the Site**:
   - Drag and drop your `index.html` file to Netlify to create a new project.
   - Alternatively, connect your GitHub repository to Netlify for easy automatic deployment.

## Troubleshooting
- **API Key Issues**: Make sure your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions.
- **Stuck on Loading**: If the "Audio is being created..." message hangs for too long, verify your network connection. Check the browser console for detailed error messages.
- **Deployment Issues**: If deploying on Netlify or GitHub Pages, ensure all required files are committed and that the correct branch is selected.
